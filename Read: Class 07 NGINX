What are some common use cases for NGINX?


An instance of NGINX can be configured as any of the following:

A web server. This is the most common because of its performance and scalability.
A reverse proxy server. NGINX does this by directing the client’s request to the appropriate back-end server.
A load balancer. It automatically distributes your network traffic load without manual configuration.
An API gateway. This is useful for request routing, authentication, and exception handling.
A firewall for web applications. This protects your application by filtering incoming and outgoing network requests on your server.
A cache. NGINX acts as a cache to help store your data for future requests.
Protection against distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
K8s. These automate deployments and scaling and manage containerized applications.
A sidecar proxy. This routes traffic to and from the container it runs alongside.


How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?



NGINX handles tasks that could slow down the web server through:

Asynchronous, event-driven architecture for efficient multitasking.
Lightweight resource usage to ensure responsiveness even under heavy loads.
Caching mechanisms to serve frequently accessed content quickly.
Load balancing to evenly distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Efficient connection handling, including keep-alive connections.
Rate limiting and throttling to manage incoming traffic effectively.

These features collectively ensure NGINX maintains optimal performance and stability, even during high-demand situations.



Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it.

You can think  "NGINX" as  "Engine" plus an "X" at the end, so you can see that it works like an engine performing various (X) tasks.
An organization might choose to use is as it have many applications.
"More" Technichally speaking, NGINX is a powerful web server software used by several hosting companies. It was designed to handle a high volume of requests simultaneously. Therefore, it offers faster loading times and better performance than most other web servers. Additionally, NGINX uses fewer resources and hardware than other server software
